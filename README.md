## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vue JS](https://vuejs.org/) - JS library

### Continued development

I added a functionality so that when the menu slides down, the screen locks and you can't scroll. The solution works but, the scroll bar disappears, and made a small jump. To solve this I implemented an additional space that covered the space of the scroll bar, in this way I eliminate the jump, but it is not a solution that satisfies me completely. But it is already out of the scope of this test.
